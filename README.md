👋 Hey, I'm Ibrahim Olukokun

A Creative Designer Engineer with a passion for building beautiful and user-centric web experiences. 
With years of experience in UI/UX and Graphics Design, I'm now diving deeper into JavaScript and modern frontend frameworks to bring design ideas to life through code.

- 👀 I’m interested in Frontend Development, Design Systems, Creative Engineering, and UI/UX Innovation.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript deeply, exploring React & Vue, and building fun mini-projects.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open source, frontend tools, and anything design-to-code focused.

- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I teach design on YouTube and still can’t function properly without my morning coffee ☕️
