👋 Hey, I'm Ibrahim Olukokun

A frontend developer with a design-first mindset and a growing passion for building intuitive, accessible, and responsive web experiences. With 5+ years in UI/UX and visual design, I now bridge the gap between great design and functional code — creating products that not only look good but work beautifully.

- 👀 I’m interested in Frontend Development, Design Systems, Creative Engineering, and UI/UX Innovation.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript deeply, exploring React & Vue, and building fun mini-projects.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open source, frontend tools, and anything design-to-code focused.
- 📫 Reach me at: [iolukokun@gmail.com](mailto:iolukokun@gmail.com) or connect on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ibrahimolukokun)
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I teach design on YouTube and still can’t function properly without my morning coffee ☕️
